      <h1>The US Police Shooting data</h1>
      <div>
        <p>
          US police shootings and Racism have been a hot topic in recent times. I wanted to examine how using a slice(Rhetorical Device, omission) of an entire dataset may lead to misleading information. I have used the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/ahsen1330/us-police-shootings" target="_blank">US police shooting dataset</a> to frame two opposing viewpoints. For the Left plot, we consider all the police shooting in the US for states other than Arizona, California, and Texas. And for the Right plot, I have considered only the states of Arizona, California, and Texas. The data on the left shows that Hispanic people killed were a smaller number compared to other communities. But for the southern states of Arizona, Texas, and California, where most Hispanics live, the figures are entirely different. Analysts and People who want to run a narrative can use these plots individually to bolster their point.
